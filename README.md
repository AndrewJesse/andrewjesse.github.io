<p>This website serves as my personal portfolio and resume website. It showcases my skills, experience, and projects I have worked on. It is an ongoing project that I will continue to update as I gain more skills and complete more projects.</p>
<p>The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. It features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The main menu allows visitors to navigate to different sections of the website, including an about section, my skills and experience, my projects, and my contact information.</p>
<p>Overall, this website is a reflection of my passion for programming and my dedication to continuously improving my skills. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning more about me as a developer.</p>
