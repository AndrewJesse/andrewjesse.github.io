        Hey there! I'm a 33-year-old programming enthusiast, currently studying
        at Portland Community College. I'm just one term away from earning my
        Associates Degree, and after that, I'll begin my plans to pursue a B.S.
        online in Software Engineering with a focus on C# at Western Governors
        University. In the meantime, I'm thoroughly enjoying my student life and
        making the most of my free time by dabbling in various hobbies.

        Right now, I'm into Science Fiction and Techno-Thriller books. They're
        my ticket to escaping the daily grind and sparking my creative side. I'm
        also a fan of tuning into podcasts while strolling around the
        neighborhood or pumping iron at the gym â€“ it's the perfect way to get
        away from the computer and mantain some semblance of physical activity.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        When it comes to unwinding, I'm partial to computer games like World of
        Warcraft and Counter Strike. I wouldn't call myself a hardcore gamer,
        but these digital adventures are a fun way to kick back and relax.
        Ultimately, I'm all about expanding my horizons and embracing new
        experiences, be it through books, programming, or games.
