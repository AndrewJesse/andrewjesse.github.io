        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm a 33-year-old programming enthusiast, currently
          studying at Portland Community College. I'm just one term away from
          earning my Associates Degree, and after that, I'll begin my plans to
          pursue a B.S. in Software Engineering with a focus on C# online at
          Western Governors University. In the meantime, I'm thoroughly enjoying
          my student life and making the most of my free time by dabbling in
          various hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm into Science Fiction and Techno-Thriller books. They're
          my ticket to escaping the daily grind and sparking my creative side.
          I'm also a fan of tuning into podcasts while strolling around the
          neighborhood or pumping iron at the gym â€“ it's the perfect blend of
          staying informed, entertained, and active.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to unwinding, I'm partial to computer games like World
          of Warcraft and Counter Strike. I wouldn't call myself a hardcore
          gamer, but these digital adventures are a fun way to kick back and
          relax. Ultimately, I'm all about expanding my horizons and embracing
          new experiences, be it through books, podcasts, or games.
